**What is User Interface Design?**
 User Interface (UI) Design is the link between users and your website. It includes the basic design elements that need to be present in order to for someone to navigate your site and make decisions. It is the ever-evolving relationship between a person and the system that they are using. It includes the way that your website interacts with users, the overall design and how information is presented. There are many different ways that you can look at user interface, but the basics always include the communication from a product to the user and vice versa. UI Design is all about structure, user manipulation and communication
**Why is User Interface Design so Important?**

User Interface Design is one of the reasons that your website will start to see an influx in traffic. It draws people in and keeps them there. It is what makes people recommend your site and become loyal customers. Regardless of what anyone says, it should never be overlooked.
In addition to basic design changes like shapes of buttons and color schemes, chances are people won’t stay on your site if it’s difficult to interact with. When people visit your website, their user experience should be one of your top priorities. When people have a good experience on your site, the conversion rates are higher and they tend to tell more people about it. This means more chances to get your sales up and even higher opportunities to grow your customer base

**here are a few basics that should never be overlooked**
*Easily Navigable Menus:
One thing that we can’t stress enough is the navigation menu. Don’t make things impossible to get to. Every part of your page should be clearly labeled on the navigation menu and placed strategically for the users
#Simple Design
While fancy layouts and multiple interface patterns may be tempting, it actually makes it more difficult for users. When you stick to simple design your target audience is able to see what your products or services are clearly and without confusion
#Usability Testing
This is a process that involves watching a group of users interacting with your website or application in order to see what works and what doesn’t.
#Be Consistent
Across your website you should make sure that you are using common elements. This allows people to understand patterns and learn how your site works more quickly and more efficiently. Having consistent patterns, languages and functions will benefit you more than you can imagine.
#Communication is Key
When something goes right, or wrong, the user should be able to tell. Make sure that your website creates defaults and communicates effectively with your users.
#Don’t Ignore Typography
Just as the typography of your website is important in your branding, it also affects usability. It needs much more attention than we used to think and can actually illicit specific responses from users

**What is user experience design?**
User experience (UX) is the relationship between a product and the person using it. UX design focuses on building products that someone can easily use and enjoy using.

**USER EXPERIENCE UX**
“User experience design is about supporting user’s needs, but making sure not to distract them from the overall experience of the product.

The story you’re telling about a product should speak exactly to the intended audience with no unnecessary jargon or imagery.

**Soft skills UX designers need**
To help us answer this question, we spoke to UX Engineer, Fabio Rose, to get a better idea of some of the soft skills a UX designer needs to succeed in the industry.
1. Empathy: UX design leads with users in mind. You’ll need to investigate and completely understand the motivations, anxieties, needs, and problems of the people who will use your design
2. Organization: UX design is like a puzzle. You can’t miss a single piece of research if you want it to be complete
3. Curiosity: UX designers need to stay curious. If you want to discover that last piece to your UX design puzzle that ties everything together in harmony, a certain amount of curiosity is needed.
**What’s the difference between UX and UI design?**

The main difference to bear in mind is this: UX design is all about the overall feel of the experience, while UI design is all about how the product’s interfaces look and function.
