**What is user experience (UX)**
User experience, or UX, is a term used to describe the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service in a given context. Depending on how the product or service is designed, the experience can range from delightful to downright frustrating!

You’ll often hear about UX in relation to digital products, such as websites and apps—but UX isn’t limited to the digital space. Anything that can be experienced can be designed, from the packaging of a toothbrush to the wheels of an orthopaedic chair.

The impact of good (and bad!) UX is everywhere. That’s one of the reasons it’s such an exciting field, and also explains why you already know a lot more about UX than you realize. Every time you curse a push door that has a pull bar, or close a confusing website in frustration, you’re making a judgement on the quality of its UX design

**What is user experience design (UXD)**
User experience design, or UXD, considers each and every element that shapes the user experience. It’s all about designing specifically for the needs of the user or customer, looking at things like ease of use, quality, and efficiency.
**Where does UX design come from**
The term “UX” was first coined in the 1990s by Dr. Donald Norman, an electrical engineer and cognitive scientist at Apple. A pioneer of user-centered design, Norman emphasized the importance of designing based on the needs and goals of the end user. In doing so, he introduced the term “user experience”, which, in Norman’s own words, is meant to encompass “all aspects of a person’s experience with a system

**What do good and bad UX look like**
We’re now going to look at two cases of good vs. bad UX. We’ll start with a familiar physical object before moving on to a digital example.

**Wireframes & prototypes**
Once the steps in the user journey have been mapped out, I can start to define how the content on each page should be organized, as well as how these pages can fit together in a way that’s intuitive and easy for the user to navigate. This is where wireframes and prototypes come in.

**How do UX designers and UI designers work together?**
It’s important to note that visual design doesn’t typically come under the UX design process; that’s the role of the user interface (UI) designer. So, once I’ve taken care of the layout and information architecture, the UI designer steps in to handle the aesthetics.

UI designers also have a solid understanding of the user’s needs and goals, but their speciality lies in the user’s visual experience. Based on the UX designer’s wireframes and prototypes, they design all the visual aspects of the product interface, such as color, typography, and spacing, as well as the interactive touchpoints that the user encounters, such as buttons and scrollbars.

 **An introduction to the UX design quadrant model**
On top of the foundational UX design skills (like prototyping, user empathy, user testing, etc.), many UX designers also choose to specialize in one or two areas depending on their interests, skills, and the needs of their employer.

What is User Research?
As the job title suggests, UX researchers focus on the research aspect of design. They conduct both qualitative and quantitative research, gathering in-depth insights into the target users. As a UX research specialist, you can expect to work closely with the product team to identify research questions, to plan and lead user research sessions (such as interviews, surveys, usability tests, etc.)

What is Interaction Design?
Interaction design focuses on how a user interacts with specific elements of a digital product. This quadrant looks at the structure and behaviour of interactive systems, and how they can be designed and optimized for human use.

Interaction designers answer questions like: “What happens when a user clicks a button?” or “How will the user transition between different pages on a mobile app?” Ultimately, they look at how to reduce friction between the product and the user.

 What are some other specialist career paths for UX designers? 
UX design is an ever-growing field, offering plenty of opportunity to both specialize and diversify. So what other job titles do UX designers end up procuring? Let’s take a look.

UX writer
Written copy plays a crucial part in the overall user experience, and just like all the visual touchpoints, the words on the product interface also need to be designed! Dedicated UX writers are increasingly sought-after, and this is a great potential career path if you want to combine copywriting with UX. You can learn all about what a UX writer actually does in this guide.

Voice designer
The global voice and speech recognition market is estimated to be worth a whopping $31.82 billion by 2025—meaning that voice designers are in high demand! Voice designers apply UX principles in order to create user-friendly interactions with voice technology. They conduct research, create personas and placeonas, define the information architecture, and design user flows, scripts, and dialogs. You can learn more about the role of the voice designer here.

UX developer
Traditionally, designers and developers belong to two very separate camps. These days, however, more and more designers are choosing to pick up some frontend coding skills and become so-called UX developers. A UX developer is best described as part-designer, part-developer, and the role generally involves some visual design skills, too.
**What are the most important soft skills for UX designers?**
Communication
Empathy
Organization

 **What is a UX design portfolio?**
A UX design portfolio is an online exhibition of a UX designer’s work. It’s a personal website that introduces you as a designer and showcases a selection of projects that you’ve worked on. The aim of your UX portfolio is to demonstrate your process—not just the end result. Unlike other design fields that focus on the visual elements of design, UX is more concerned with how you got there: How did you identify and solve the user problem? What processes did you go through?
